# Library-Management-System
<p>In this Library Management System project, you can add records of new books and access details of the books available in the library. The system allows you to issue books to students and keep track of their records. A late fee is charged to students who return issued books past the due date. Each student is allowed to borrow only one book at a time, and new books cannot be issued to students who have not yet returned their previous book.</p>
